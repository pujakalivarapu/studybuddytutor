## Project Summary

This Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Engine combines LangChain, Streamlit, and Pinecone to create a robust web application for document analysis, summarization, and interactive Q&A. Users can upload PDFs, generate vector embeddings from the text, and engage in conversational interactions with the content. The system maintains chat history for a more dynamic experience.

## Key Capabilities

- **Web Interface**: Built on Streamlit for user-friendly interaction
- **Credential Management**: Secure input for OpenAI and Pinecone API keys
- **Multi-PDF Upload**: Process multiple documents simultaneously
- **Text Chunking**: Divide documents into manageable segments for model compatibility
- **Embedding Generation**: Convert text chunks to vector embeddings
- **Storage Options**: Choose between Pinecone or local vector storage
- **Conversational AI**: Engage in Q&A sessions with uploaded documents, with persistent chat history
- **Learning Tools**: Generate flashcards, lesson plans, and quizzes from documents

## System Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- LangChain library
- Streamlit framework
- Valid OpenAI API key
- PDF documents for analysis
